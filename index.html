<h1>Thoughts on Tip: 6. Communicate!</h1>
<p style="font-family:courier;">
  This is a paragraph.I think it is really important for people in the tech feild to be reminded that code isn't the only important thing.
  It is not only important how good of a coder you are but also to be a good employee and person. Coders work on teams
  to be a good team member, employee and coworker a coder must communicate well with others. When it comes to communication
  in most other job areas it is understood how important it is when speaking with others and being a good team member.
  Often times in computer science it is forgotten that coders dont only talk to coders they will have to communicate their
  ideas to people who do not understand the code that has been written so a coder needs to be able to explain the code
  to people with other backgrounds. It is important for coders to understand who they are talking to and change how
  they speak depending on it.

Coders also are taught that it is all about their code, if they have a solid idea for code then it doesnt matter
how it is presented or how they look when presteing it. That is not that case most of the time, if you want your
ideas to be taken seriously they need to be presented in a organized, well thought out presention. Also the
coder themselves need to be presentable. Tech companies are famous for letting their employees wear whatevr they
want. That is great for everyday work but when you have to present your ideas in a offical meeting with people
who arent in your department. You should present yourself and your ideas in a visually appealing way. Leave the
sweats home that day and put on some jeans. The way you and your ideas look need to professional, in the picture below
the man giving the presination is dressed casually but not to casually and he has a good looking presintation. That is
an example of what a good presintation and a casual but still acceptable outfit for a less formal meeting
